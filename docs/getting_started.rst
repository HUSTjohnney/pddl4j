What is PDDL4J ?
================

PDDL4J is a software library embedding Artificial Intelligence algorithms to find solutions for planning problems, that
is to say time organized actions to achieve a goal. Solutions to planning problems are "todo lists" named **plan** representing operational features of actions like **who, how, where, when and what to do**.

PDDL4J uses a description language (Planning Domain Description language) to represent the initial state of the problem, the goal and the list of the available actions. A complete description of the PDDL syntax is available [here](http://pddl4j.imag.fr/repository/wiki/BNF-PDDL-3.1.pdf). The complete description of the PDDL syntax implemented in PDDL4J will be available soon.

PDDL4J is a suite of solvers useful for decision problems that can be solved by a sequence of actions (plan). It is based on a declarative approach: the user **states** a decision problem in PDDL and PDDL4J generates possible solutions. **No programming language and/or background** is required. PDDL4J has lot of application fields like can be use in many industrial fields as smart homes/data/cities, autonomous systems and robotics, logistics, business processes etc.

How to use PDD4J ?
==================


It is possible to use the PDDL4J library in three different ways depending on your needs:
* the user downloads the library or generates it with Gradle.
* the user integrates PDDL4J in his/her own tools and adds planning functions to his/her code.

As a developper, you can contribute to the PDDL4J project and add new features (see the [Contribute](https://github.com/pellierd/pddl4j/wiki/Contribute) dedicated page).
